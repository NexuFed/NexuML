# Ray execution

Ray is an optional placement backend for the existing NexuML Lightning session. Use it when a scenario should run on an existing Ray cluster. NexuML does not maintain a parallel Ray-specific model or training loop.

## Install

```bash
uv pip install "nexuml[ray]"
```

Add `nexuml[s3]` when Ray run storage or datasets use S3-compatible storage. Add the DALI integration separately when the selected data loader requires it.

The driver and workers need compatible Python/Ray environments. Keep exact environment/image/CUDA choices in the consuming project or cluster configuration, not in `ScenarioSpec`.

## Configure an existing cluster

```python
from nexuml.core.types import RayClusterTarget, RayExecutionSpec

execution = RayExecutionSpec(
    target=RayClusterTarget(
        address="ray://ray.example.org:10001",
        working_dir=".",
        py_executable="uv run --locked python",
    ),
    workers=4,
    resources_per_worker={"CPU": 4, "GPU": 1},
    storage_path="s3://my-bucket/nexuml/runs",
)
```

Attach it to the scenario and use the normal command:

```bash
nexuml train my-scenario
```

Each worker restores the typed scenario, creates the normal `NexuSession`, and executes its lifecycle with a Ray-prepared Lightning trainer.

## Lightning strategies

`training.strategy` remains the single source of truth. Ray currently maps `auto`/`ddp`, `fsdp`, and `deepspeed` to Ray's official Lightning strategy integrations.

```python
TrainingSpec(strategy="ddp")
```

Strategy-specific settings belong in `training.strategy_params`. Required third-party strategy packages still have to exist in the worker environment.

## Ray Jobs

NexuML intentionally does not wrap the Ray Jobs lifecycle. If the driver itself should run remotely/detached, use Ray's native CLI:

```bash
ray job submit --working-dir . -- \
  uv run --locked nexuml train -c configs/my-scenario.yaml
```

Use Ray's own status/log/stop tooling for the job lifecycle.

## Distributed semantic restrictions

Ray currently rejects two kinds of stateful post-training work rather than silently changing their meaning:

- scenarios with `evaluation.algorithms`;
- components whose definition declares `requires_post_train_fit`.

Both need global state across rank-sharded data. Until NexuML implements correct cross-worker finalization, keep those scenarios local. Ordinary Lightning validation/test metrics can still be reduced by the distributed trainer.

## Shared datasets and S3 WebDataset

A supported shared-data workflow is:

```text
NexuML dataset
  → WebDataset export
  → S3-compatible storage
  → ExportedDataset
  → worker-local shard/index staging
  → DALI WebDataset reader
```

Export to S3 with the normal dataset-export command or Python API, then use the base-library `ExportedDataset` definition for the remote root.

For S3-backed WebDataset, the current DALI integration downloads the required tar/index files through NexuML's boto3 S3 client into a worker-local temporary directory before passing local paths to DALI. This is intentional for compatibility with path-style S3-compatible endpoints; the current implementation does **not** rely on DALI directly opening arbitrary `s3://` WebDataset URLs.

Credentials/endpoints come from the normal AWS/provider environment and supported S3 options, not from persisted secrets in the scenario.

## Temporary KubeRay clusters

Cluster creation is infrastructure policy, not a second NexuML execution model. Use an infrastructure-owned KubeRay `RayJob`/cluster template to define images, CUDA, node selectors, queues, tolerations, service accounts, volumes, and autoscaling. Its entrypoint can remain the same `nexuml train ...` command.

## Troubleshooting

- **Ray import error** → install `nexuml[ray]` in the driver/worker environment.
- **Version mismatch** → align Ray/Python versions between the project and cluster.
- **Post-train/evaluation rejection** → current distributed global-finalization semantics are intentionally unsupported; run that scenario locally.
- **S3 failure** → verify credentials, endpoint/region settings, and worker access to the S3 service.
- **DALI failure** → install a compatible DALI build separately and verify `python -c "import nvidia.dali"` in the worker environment.
